# Contributing

Near Social Bridge is one of the first tools that enable integration between external React applications and [Blockchain Operating System (BOS)](https://near.org/) and it's in constant development. We’re still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we’re not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To prepare the project's environment, clone the [Near Social Bridge](https://github.com/wpdas/near-social-bridge) repo. After that, you need to clone two more repositories that are going to be used to test everything. They are: [CSR Empty Project Here](#) and [SSR Empty Project Here](#)
