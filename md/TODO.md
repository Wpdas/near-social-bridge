## TODO

Below are some things I'd like to include:

- Build Wiki;
- Use VM locally to test the app (if possible);
- Use [`near-social CLI`](https://github.com/FroVolod/near-social) to change the NearSocialBridgeCore locally and deploy to SocialDB;

2 - Snippet:

```js
import Discovery from 'near-discovery'
;<Discovery src="<widget-path-here>" OnSignTransaction={SignTransaction} />
```
