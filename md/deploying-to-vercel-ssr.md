## Deploying to Vercel (SSR)

This method works only with **Server Side Rendering** and it's a **centralized** source.

If you're using **Next.js** to build your app, you can use [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) to deploy your app and then, use the provided app URL to feed the `externalAppUrl` while [**preparing a new BOS Component**](https://github.com/wpdas/near-social-bridge/blob/main/md/preparing-new-bos-component.md).
