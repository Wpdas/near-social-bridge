/*
 This is a palliative feature to fix a bug that happens with react.
 When content inside an iframe is updated, react adds an iframe covering the entire
 screen using the maximum z-index, thus making any interaction with the application impossible.

 Using "react-error-overlay": "6.0.9" didn't fix the issue.
